# n3tuk Upstream Template Synchroniser

A GitHub Action for running [`cookiecutter`][cookiecutter] from upstream
template repositories in the `n3tuk` Organisation and apply them over the
templates repositories and submit any changes as a pull request for review and
merging.

## Features

This GitHub Action provides the following features:

- Merge upstream changes to the `cookiecutter.json` default configuration file
  with the downstream `cookiecutter.json` configuration for each templated
  repository, allowing new settings to be automatically added with the provided
  default value.
- Optionally re-render the upstream template files with the downstream
  `cookiecutter.json` configuration (with updates, if updated) and apply over
  the current repository files.
- Allow the downstream repository to ignore upstream changes to selected files
  with `.templateignore` in the root directory in the same format as
  `.gitignore`. Follow the [glob pattern][glob-pattern] in defining the files
  and folders that the action should excluded.
- Add support for updates and removal of files inside the downstream repository
  as configured inside the `cookiecutter.json` file, allowing easier migration
  of existing files and removal of old files as part of standard updates.

## Upstream

The codebase for this GitHub Action is an update on the
[`actions-template-sync`][actions-template-sync] GitHub Action, with handling of
templated file overrides (ignores), merging of upstream and downstream
cookiecutter configurations, and building the cookiecutter repository upstream
and overlaying it downstream.
